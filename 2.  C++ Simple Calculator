//C++ program to perform function of a simple Calculator
/*Program Logic
 First the user defined variables are initialized. 
 Then the Operator (+,-,*,/) is received from the user along with two inputs.
 Then by using Switch statement, the operation of calculator is performed. 
 If the user enters any operator other than (+,-,*,/), the progrom won't do calculator  operation.  While dividing operation, if the b==0, then operation will be stopped due to divide by zero error
